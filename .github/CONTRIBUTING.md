## Creating Issues

Before creating any issues, please look through the current list of issues and
pull requests, and ensure that the issue hasn't already been reported. If an
issue has already been reported, but you have some new insight, please add
a comment to the existing issue.

Please try and describe any issues reported with as much detail as you can
provide about your Vim version, the linter you were trying to run, your
operating system, or any other information you think might be helpful.

Please describe your issue in clear, grammatically correct, and easy to
understand English. You are more likely to see an issue resolved if others
can understand you.
