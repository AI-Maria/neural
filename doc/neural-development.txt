WIP

Make sure all required Python versions for testing are installed.

Neural tests against Python 3.7 and Python 3.10.

Run the following: >
  python -m pip install --user tox==4.4.5
  python -m tox
<

To get the same configuration in your editor, run `./install-python-env.sh`.
ALE should pick up on how to run `ruff` and `pyright` automatically.
